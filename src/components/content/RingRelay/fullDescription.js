const RingRelayFullDescription = `The Ring Relay is an end-to-end encrypted messaging app that allows users to securely send each
other messages and images. The app uses public key cryptography to encrypt, and authenticate
anything exchanged between users. Users have control over their account's crypto keys as well as in-
depth logs to help flag any unauthorized access. From a software stack perspective, the front-end is
written in React and the backend is a collection of serverless functions that connect the front-end to any
other services such as databases. I've also written extensive technical documentation for this project
that's available, like the source code, on my Github.`
